# SwiftUI-Playground
This is for experimenting creating kobo app homescreen with SwiftUI  

# Demo
<img src="./demo.gif" width="250" height="500"/>

# Todo

* Add momemtum for snap-carousel
* use the snap-carousel for continue reading carousel
* The navigation bar still need to have search icon next to it
* the background seems a bit incorrect compared to phoenix
